Arithmetiles is a game in which you test your speed at sorting arithmetic expressions. You are presented with sixteen tiles each containing a different mathematical expression (such as 4+7 or 5-8) and you are to tap all sixteen tiles in increasing order. There are two modes to the game, easy and hard. In easy mode, only expressions with addition are displayed and in hard mode, expressions with both addition and subtraction are given.
